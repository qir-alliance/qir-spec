# QIR Alliance

The [QIR Alliance](https://qir-alliance.org/) is a joint effort to establish a
many-to-many intermediate representation between programming languages and
current and future quantum devices, to accelerate the growth and
interoperability of the quantum ecosystem.

## Working Group Scope

This effort includes the creation of a specification for how to represent
quantum programs within the LLVM IR, developed on this repository. The
specification includes profiles for current and future quantum processor
architectures. A set of tools and samples to facilitate the adoption of the
specification can be found in the respective
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/orgs/qir-alliance/repositories) and are
licensed under MIT license unless specified otherwise.
