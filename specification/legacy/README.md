# Legacy

This section contains the older QIR specification that defines a full set of potential
runtime support (often referred to as the old "full" QIR spec or QIR v0.1). Concepts
from this runtime are used in some front-end and simulation environments, but are
not broadly supported or included as part of the agreed upon QIR Profiles. This
spec is preserved here for reference and posterity in git. The folder may be
removed in subsequent updates to the specification.
