# QIR Alliance

The [QIR Alliance](https://qir-alliance.org/) is a joint effort to establish a
many-to-many intermediate representation between programming languages and
current and future heterogenous quantum processors, to accelerate the growth and
interoperability of the quantum ecosystem.

With our work and partnership, we aim to

- reduce the required development effort for all parties by promoting
  interoperability between different frameworks and languages
- enable the development of shared libraries both for quantum application
  development, and for quantum compiler development
- build on state-of-the-art compiler technology and leverage existing tools,
  libraries and learnings from high-performance computing
- allow for incremental and progressive evolution in how classical and quantum
  computations can interact at the hardware level
- provide the flexibility to easily connect emerging technologies in a way that
  permits to experiment with distinct and differentiated hardware capabilities

## Working Group Scope

This effort includes the creation of a specification for how to represent
quantum programs within the LLVM IR, developed on this repository. It provides a
holistic program representation suitable for taking full advantage of the unique
and distinct capabilities of quantum computing systems across a variety of
different hardware platforms. The specification includes profiles for current
and future quantum processor architectures.

A set of tools and samples to facilitate the adoption of the specification can
be found in the respective [GitHub
repositories](https://github.com/orgs/qir-alliance/repositories) and are
licensed under MIT license unless specified otherwise.
